# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. The release workflow reads the section for the
version it is publishing and uses it as the release notes, so a version without a
section here does not get released.

## 0.1.0

First release.

### The engine

A port of Vega to Kotlin Multiplatform, verified differentially against upstream
Vega 6.3.1 rather than against its own expectations: 193 fixtures are compiled by
both engines and compared mark by mark, and the d3 and `vega-*` test suites are
replayed from recorded vectors.

Expressions, signals, 49 of upstream's 51 documented data transforms, every scale
type in scope, geographic projections, and an event handler that recompiles the
chart.

### Vega-Lite

A Vega-Lite compiler, compared **property by property** against upstream
Vega-Lite 6.4.3 on 282 fixtures — not only the picture it draws, because
Vega-Lite's value is in the defaults it supplies and each of those is one property
of the output. All **627** of upstream's own gallery examples compile to the
specification upstream compiles them to.

`VegaLiteInput.toVega` accepts either grammar and says which it read, on every
host.

### Renderers

- Android `Canvas`, with accessibility nodes
- Jetpack Compose, and Compose Multiplatform for Android, iOS and the desktop
- CoreGraphics for Apple platforms, in Swift
- SVG, PNG and PDF export

### Targets

`jvm`, `macosArm64`, `iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`, `linuxX64`, and Android. No
`iosX64`: `ktecma262` 0.2.0 does not publish that slice, so the target cannot
resolve its dependencies. See the platform table in README.md.

### Consuming it

Maven Central under `io.github.mgilbir.astervega`, one version for every module,
and a Swift package whose `Package.swift` at tag `vX.Y.Z` names the XCFramework of
that same release — the release workflow writes the checksum and then creates the
tag, so one tag serves both ecosystems.

Every published module carries a committed ABI dump under `api/`, for the JVM
surface and for the native one, checked by `scripts/check.sh`.

### Fixed before the first release

- `mark.clip` on a mark that is not a group was read for bounds and never applied
  when drawing, so a value past the scale's domain was painted over the axis
  instead of being hidden.
- A chart's own `name` was used verbatim where it prefixes every scale, axis and
  signal reference; upstream substitutes non-word characters, so `phq9-total`
  became `phq9_total` there and this engine disagreed with it.
- An unknown top-level Vega-Lite property was dropped without a diagnostic, and
  `usermeta` — which upstream carries onto the compiled Vega — was one of them.
- A `$schema` naming another major version of Vega-Lite was compiled with version
  6 rules and said nothing about it.
